# AUDIOMETRY---Basys3-Pmod-I2S2
FPGA-based tonal audiometry system for preliminary hearing evaluation and early detection of hearing loss. Developed entirely in VHDL on the Basys 3 board with an Artix-7 FPGA.

This project implements a tonal audiometry system on an FPGA platform, aimed at the preliminary assessment of hearing capabilities and the early detection of potential hearing impairments. The system is developed using VHDL and deployed on a Digilent Basys 3 board featuring a Xilinx Artix-7 FPGA. It generates sinusoidal tones across a range of frequencies typically used in clinical audiometry tests and outputs audio using the Pmod I2S2 module. The design is entirely digital and includes modules for signal generation, volume control, state sequencing, and frequency display.
